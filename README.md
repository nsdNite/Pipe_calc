# Round Pipe Calculator v1.1

## Overview

This Python script provides a simple GUI-based calculator for calculating the mass and mass per meter of a round pipe. It allows users to input the diameter, wall thickness, length, and density of the material to perform calculations. The results are displayed along with a history window to keep track of previous calculations.

## How to Use

1. **Input Parameters**: Enter the values for the diameter, wall thickness, length, and density of the material in the corresponding entry fields.

2. **Quick Density Selection**: Choose a predefined density for common materials using the radio buttons under "Quick density."

3. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to perform the calculations.

4. **View Results**: The calculated mass and mass per meter will be displayed in the designated entry fields.

5. **History Window**: View a history of previous calculations in the history window. Use the "Clear history" button to reset the history.

6. **Export History**: Click the "Export history" button to save the calculation history to a CSV file.
